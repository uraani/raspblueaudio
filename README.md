# Raspblueaudio

Adds support for streaming bluetooth audio from phone to Raspberry Pi using ALSA.
## Motivation
I wanted as lean as possible bluetooth streaming setup on Rasperry Pi. Emphasis is also on audio quality so by default only aptX is supported.
## Features
- Optional pin code authentication
- Connect and disconnect sounds
## Install
```
git clone https://github.com/uraani/raspblueaudio.git
cd raspblueaudio
sudo ./install.sh
```
